## Dependency Management

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.5</version>
    <scope>provided<scope>
</dependency>
```

All possible `scope` tag are:
- compile
  - The dependency (JAR) would be required during the compilation time of the project as well as during the runtime. (The JAR library will be made available in all the CLASSPATH)
- provided
  - We assume the library will be made available during the run time and that we don't have to include it while packaging. (eg. ServletAPI.JAR is required during the compile time, but we don't really need to package that jar file inside our war file because ServletAPI.JAR is also available as part of the Tomcat server library and is available when we run the servlet.
- runtime
  - Certain libraries are not required during the compile time such as JDBC API. JDBC API is required during the compile time that helps us connect to a database, but we don't need the actual driver implementation code during the compile time because it would be provided by the database server.
- test
  - Only be made available during unit testing
- system
  - When you have a dependency that is not part of any repository or a dependency that is external to a repository, then we call it an external dependency. Set this when you want to manage dependency on your own instead of letting Maven doing it for you.
  - You would also need the `<systemPath>` to manage external dependencies.
