## Dependency Management

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.5</version>
    <scope>provided<scope>
</dependency>
```

All possible `scope` tag are:
- compile
  - The dependency (JAR) would be required during the compilation time of the project as well as during the runtime. (The JAR library will be made available in all the CLASSPATH)
- provided
  - We assume the library will be made available during the run time and that we don't have to include it while packaging. (eg. ServletAPI.JAR is required during the compile time, but we don't really need to package that jar file inside our war file because ServletAPI.JAR is also available as part of the Tomcat server library and is available when we run the servlet.
- runtime
  - Certain libraries are not required during the compile time such as JDBC API. JDBC API is required during the compile time that helps us connect to a database, but we don't need the actual driver implementation code during the compile time because it would be provided by the database server.
- test
  - Only be made available during unit testing
- system
  - When you have a dependency that is not part of any repository or a dependency that is external to a repository, then we call it an external dependency. Set this when you want to manage dependency on your own instead of letting Maven doing it for you.
  - You would also need the `<systemPath>` to manage external dependencies.

## Transitive dependencies, Optional dependencies and Exclusions

Maven would download not just dependencies (eg. Project A is directly dependent on Project B), but dependencies of dependencies. (eg. Project A is transitively dependent on Project C and D). However, in some cases we may not be needing all the JAR files in order for our project to work.

- For example, let's say that Project C Java file is required for Project B in order for it to build, but is not required for our project. It's only for the purpose of Project B completion to work.
- The developers of Project B can mention that the dependency of Project C is optional, meaning that Project B is explicitly mentioning that whoever is going to mention the Project B's dependency may not be requiring to download the Project C.

- If however, if the developers of Project B forget to mention that the dependency of Project C is optional. We could manually include the exclusion tag.

A JAR (Java Archive) file is a compressed file format used to package Java classes, resources, and metadata into a single file. Here are a few cases where a JAR file is not needed for a project to work but only needed in order for the project to successfully build:

- Unit testing: During the development of a Java application, unit tests may be created to ensure that each component of the application functions correctly. While the unit tests can be run independently of the JAR file, the JAR file may be required to build the test suite.
- Building documentation: JavaDoc is a tool that generates HTML documentation for Java classes. To build JavaDoc, the JAR file containing the classes must be present.
- Dependency management: Java applications often rely on third-party libraries, which are typically packaged as JAR files. Build tools like Maven and Gradle can automatically download these dependencies from a repository, so the JAR files themselves are not required during development.
- Code analysis: Static analysis tools like Checkstyle and FindBugs can be used to scan Java code for potential bugs and style violations. These tools typically require the JAR file to be present so they can analyze the code.
- Packaging: Java applications can be packaged in a variety of ways, including as an executable JAR file, a WAR (Web Archive) file, or an EAR (Enterprise Archive) file. While the JAR file is required to create these packages, it may not be needed to run the application.

## IMPORTANT
- The dependencies scope will also affect the transitive dependencies.

- For example:
  - Project A has direct dependency on Project B with the scope of `compile`
  - Project B has direct dependency on Project D with the scope of `runtime`
  - This means Project A has transitive dependency on project D with the scope of `runtime`
  - Then the resulting scope of project D on Project A would be of `runtime` scope
